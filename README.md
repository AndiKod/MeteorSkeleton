## Usage

No surprises :
```
$ git clone https://github.com/AndreiCurelaru/MeteorSkeleton.git MyAppName
$ cd MyAppName
$ meteor 
```
At that point, you should be able to see your basic app on http://localhost:3000 or 127.0.0.1:3000

I'll complete this README with more details on the included files and directories, plus some other ressources. You can of course remove any pakage with someting like `$ meteor remove nooitaf:semantic-ui` and install whatever else you need from [Atmosphere](https://atmospherejs.com/).

If you see other needed packages for a good start, have questions or ideas, fell free to open Issues, or get in touch.
